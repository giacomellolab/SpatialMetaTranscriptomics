1. Code to do TSO trimming of the reads and filtering afterwards. 
2. ST Pipeline to process the reads to gene count matrix. This is for the host transcripts only.
3. Identify putative microbial reads from the reads that are not mapped to host genome and demultiplexing their spatial barcode and their probe.
